# Security System
This project is a Security System which can be implmented in any house, using simple components: keypad, buzzer for alarm, ESP8266 as a WIFi module.
If a person enters the house code wrong 4 times, the owner of the house will receive a message alert suggesting the possibility of someone breaking the house, 
and the alarm will be turned on.
The system has also a ringbell: if someone presses the ringbell, the owner will be notified about someone being at the door.
All the notifications are send to the owner's phone.
